# Creative Writing Website

1. I am trying to create a platform where people can share creative writing and recieve feedback and followers of people who want to read their writing.
    1. Writers: People who write and post stories on the site and recieve feedback. 
    1. Readers: people who read rate and comment on stories.
1. I will accomplish this by building a functional website that allows people to post stories and engage with other peopel's writing as either a writer or strictl a reader.
1. I will use the LinkedIn Web API and its social features that allow following people and commenting.
